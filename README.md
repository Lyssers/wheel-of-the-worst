# Wheel Of Misfortune
Pick Your (Bad) Movie for Tonight.

Small silly Java program meant to mimic the online show "Best Of The Worst" by RedLetterMedia.

Uses a small list of movies picked from some of IMDB's worst rated films and randomly selects one.

### ***"True Evil never dies, it is only... reborn"***

Requires Java to run: https://www.java.com/en/download/

Latest Release: https://github.com/Lyssers/wheel-of-the-worst/releases/latest

Now with a reworked, better, user interface and pulling movie data from IMDB using OMDB API.

TODO:
1) Add sound effects! Who doesn't love obnoxious loud music and sound effects?
~2) More animations, more more more (yes i learned the basics of JavaFX yesterday how could you tell?)~
3) Add more movies / **find some way to pull movies from iMDB/Rotten Tomatoes/etc directly.**
4) Remove any movies that were added by accident/resolve ambiguity in some movie titles
